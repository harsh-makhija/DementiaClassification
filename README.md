### Dementia and Alzheimers Classification


In this report, I embark on a comprehensive analysis of a biomedical tabular
dataset, emphasizing longitudinal data related to dementia and Alzheimer's
disease. This dataset, rich in complexity, chronicles patient histories across
multiple visits and incorporates diverse features, including demographic, socio-
economic, and medical variables.
I primarily aim to utilize machine learning techniques—specifically, Random
Forests and Support Vector Classifiers—to classify patients' dementia status
based on the dataset's features. A crucial element of our investigation is
identifying the most influential features within these machine learning models
that determine dementia classification. Moreover, I intend to delve into the
characteristics of patient groups, seeking insights into trends in dementia status.
This endeavour is an exercise in data analysis and a step toward a deeper
understanding of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, potentially contributing to
improved patient care and outcomes.
